    "response": "**Assessing Your Tomato Crop's Needs**\n\nYour 25-day-old tomato plants are showing signs of stress, likely due to inadequate watering and nutrient supply. To address slow growth and yellow leaves, focus on balancing soil moisture and providing essential nutrients.\n\n**Fertilizer Mix Recommendation**\n\n* Use a balanced fertilizer with a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) ratio of 10-10-10 or 20-20-20.\n* Consider adding a micronutrient-rich fertilizer to address potential deficiencies.\n\n**Watering Schedule and Soil Moisture Balance**\n\n* Water your tomato plants every 2-3 days, aiming for 20-25 mm of water per application.\n* Maintain a soil moisture balance of 60-80% field capacity. Check soil moisture by inserting your finger into the soil up to the knuckle.\n* Avoid overwatering, which can exacerbate issues.\n\n**Practical Water-Saving Methods**\n\n* Implement drip irrigation or soaker hoses to deliver water directly to the roots, reducing evaporation and runoff.\n* Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.\n\n**Weather and Rainfall Data**\n\n* Keep an eye on local weather forecasts to adjust your watering schedule accordingly. Avoid watering before heavy rainfall.\n* Consider using a rain gauge or weather station to fine-tune your irrigation plan.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to address your tomato plants' current stress and set them up for optimal growth and yield. Monitor your plants' response and adjust your strategy as needed.",

    "response": "**Watering Tomatoes with Confidence**\n\nAs a farmer, you want to give your tomato plants the right amount of water to thrive. Here are some region-independent tips to help you optimize irrigation:\n\n**Watering Intervals:**\n\n* **Seedling stage (1-2 weeks after planting):** Water every 2-3 days to maintain soil moisture.\n* **Fruiting stage (after 2 weeks):** Water every 4-5 days, or when the top 2-3 inches of soil feels dry.\n\n**Soil Moisture Balance:**\n\n* Check soil moisture by inserting a finger into the soil up to the knuckle. If the soil feels dry, it's time to water.\n* Aim for a soil moisture balance of 20-30% (not too wet, not too dry).\n\n**Water-Saving Methods:**\n\n* **Drip irrigation:** Delivers water directly to the roots, reducing evaporation and runoff.\n* **Mulching:** Retains soil moisture, suppresses weeds, and regulates soil temperature.\n* **Scheduling:** Water during cooler parts of the day (early morning or evening) to minimize evaporation.\n\n**Rainfall and Weather Forecasts:**\n\n* **Rainfall:** Adjust your watering schedule according to rainfall. If it's rained, you may not need to water for a few days.\n* **Weather forecasts:** Plan your watering schedule around upcoming hot or dry spells to ensure your plants receive enough moisture.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to provide your tomato plants with the right amount of water, reduce waste, and optimize yields.
